  Exploring Seamless User Experiences with the View Transitions API that is recently built natively to the browser.
---




In the dynamic realm of web development, creating engaging and seamless user experiences is a constant pursuit. As websites and applications strive to captivate users with fluidity and elegance, the View Transitions API emerges as a valuable tool, allowing developers to enhance navigation and transitions within their projects.

## Understanding the View Transitions API
The View Transitions API is a powerful addition to the web developer's toolkit, providing a standardized way to handle and animate transitions between views. It empowers developers to create smooth, visually appealing transitions as users navigate through different sections or pages of a website or application.

## Key Features
### Consistent Transitions:
With the View Transitions API, developers can ensure consistency in transition effects across various elements on a webpage. This consistency contributes to a more polished and professional appearance, elevating the overall user experience.

### Enhanced User Engagement:
By incorporating seamless transitions, developers can enhance user engagement. Smooth transitions between views help maintain user interest and prevent disorientation, fostering a more enjoyable and intuitive browsing experience.

### Easy Implementation:
The API simplifies the implementation process, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels. Its straightforward syntax and integration with existing web technologies ensure that developers can quickly adopt it into their projects without a steep learning curve.

```css
.title {
  view-transition-name: title;
}

```

### [Astro](https://astro.build)
astro was one of the first web frameworks to implement it to be able to use trivially, with some features.
- interopability with js.
- fallback if the browser doesn't support it.
- neat abstractions in top of the browser APIs. 

and that's why this portfolio is built with astro, to render into just a static html, evading all the temptation to use fancy state managament tools that ship Mbs of js that is not needed to the browser.
