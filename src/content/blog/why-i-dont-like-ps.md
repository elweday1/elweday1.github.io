## Motivation

When I was first introduced to problem solving I didn't find appealing as others do, Yeah I know it's probably a `skill issue` but here are my reasons. It's almost like tic tac toe, mathematically solved every problem comes with a specific concentration of one or multiple data structures or algorithms. And for me it felt like a chore, as if we all had to do the same essence then use none of it.

## Tranditional LeetCode-like problem solving.

### Areas of interest
Though it seems it has a variety of topics but it is still constrained to data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithmic techniques (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)

### Code Style
Solutions are more about functionality than elegance. The emphasis is on solving the problem
efficiently rather than creating modular, maintainable code. This encourages participants to
focus on algorithmic prowess rather than polished software engineering practices.
Also that maybe what makes people like it, as sticking to strict rules is no fun.

### Programming Paradigms
Problems are carefully crafted to require a specific programming paradigm,
avoiding functional or object-oriented programming. This limitation challenges participants
to deepen their understanding of procedural programming and algorithmic thinking.
However, this aspect does'nt push you forward if not pushes you back. because you will indeed need these other paradigms.


### Testcases
> It's tedious to find what is wrong without knowing what makes it wrong.

- **Limited Test Case Visibility**: While the criteria for correctness are provided in the editorial, the actual test cases may not be visible to participants.
This deliberate lack of transparency adds an extra layer of challenge. which does eaither of two things:
  * Challenges your brain to achieve it's full potenial.
  * Makes you want immideate, peaceful death.

- **Debugging Challenges**: Debugging becomes more complex when participants can't see which test case(s) failed. Yeah this mirrors real-world scenarios where identifying the root cause of an issue can be challenging. but you can't reach the root of the issue if you don't know what even went wrong. However, it builds resilience and problem-solving skills even in scenarios with limited information.








### Metrics

## Advent Of code
As stated per their website, [Advent Of code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

it happens throught the december of every year but the problems are publically available you can always get to older problems.

### Code Style
code style is still disposable and have even more freedom which is not eaither good or a bad thing
